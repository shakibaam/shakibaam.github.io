    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Shakiba Amirshahi and I'm originally from Iran. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at Amirkabir University of Technology, also known as Tehran Polytechnique.</p>
    <p>Currently, I'm pursuing my Master's studies in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo, starting in September 2024. My research interests mainly revolve around Natural Language Processing and Data Science. For my Master's thesis, I investigated the limitations of large language models and proposed ways to overcome them.</p>
    <p>My hobbies include calligraphy, photography, and writing short stories. I am passionate about learning and try to learn something new every day.</p>
